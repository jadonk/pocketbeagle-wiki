This is some text about the disclaimers and warrenty

= '''1.0 Introduction ''' =

This document is the '''System Reference Manual''' for the PocketBeagle and covers its use and design. These are some nice introductory sentences regarding the value proposition of the PocketBeagle and BeagleBoard.org

This design is subject to change without notice as we will work to keep improving the design as the product matures based on feedback and experience. Software updates will be frequent and will be independent of the hardware revisions and as such not result in a change in the revision number.

Make sure you check the support Wiki frequently for the most up to date information.
