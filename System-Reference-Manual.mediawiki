= '''1.0 Introduction ''' =

This document is the '''System Reference Manual''' for the PocketBeagle and covers its use and design. 
PocketBeagle is an ultra-tiny-yet-complete Linux-enabled, community-supported, open-source USB-key-fob-computer.  PocketBeagle features an incredible low cost, slick design and simple usage, making it the ideal development board for beginners and professionals alike.  Simply develop directly in a web browser providing you with a playground for programming and electronics.  Exploring is made easy with several available libraries and tutorials with many more coming.  

PocketBeagle will boot directly from a microSD card.  Load a Linux distribution onto your microSD card, plug your board into your computer and get started.  PocketBeagle runs GNU.Linux, so you can leverage many different high-level programming languages and a large body of drivers that that prevent you from needing to write a lot of your own software.  

This design will keep improving as the product matures based on feedback and experience. Software updates will be frequent and will be independent of the hardware revisions and as such not result in a change in the revision number.

Make sure you check the support Wiki frequently for the most up to date information.

= '''3.0 Connecting Up Your PocketBeagle ''' =

This section provides instructions on how to hook up your board. The most common scenario is tethering your PocketBeagle to and using your PC for local development.

=== 3.1 What’s In the Package  ===

In the package you will find two items as shown in '''Figure x'''.

* PocketBeagle
* Getting Started instruction card with link to the support URL.

[[https://github.com/jadonk/pocketbeagle-wiki/blob/master/images/pocketbeagle_package_small_size.jpg]] [[https://github.com/jadonk/pocketbeagle-wiki/blob/master/images/PB-card-front-1.jpg]][[https://github.com/jadonk/pocketbeagle-wiki/blob/master/images/PB-card-back-1.jpg]]

======  Figure x. In The Package  ======

=== 3.2 Connecting the board ===

This section will describe how to connect to the board. Information can also be found on the Quick Start Guide that came in the box. Detailed information is also available at
[https://beagleboard.org/getting-started ''beagleboard.org/getting-started'' ]

The board can be configured in several different ways, but we will discuss the two most common scenarios.

* Tethered to a PC via the USB cable with local development
** Board is accessed as a storage drive through standard windows/mac folders
** Board is accessed via ethernet over USB (RNDIS Ethernet) communication
* Connecting the PocketBeagle to a PC via USB cable and configuring to share access
** Board is accessed via the internet

=== 3.3 Tethered to a PC using Debian Images ===

In this configuration, you will need the following additional items: 
* microUSB to USB Type A Cable
* microSD card (>=4GB and <128GB)

The board is powered by the PC via the USB cable--no other cables are required. The board is accessed either as a USB storage drive or via a web browser on the PC. You need to use either Firefox or Chrome on the PC, IE will not work properly. '''Figure x''' shows this configuration.

<blockquote>will MS edge work if IE does not?</blockquote>

[[https://github.com/jadonk/pocketbeagle-wiki/blob/master/images/PB-tethered.png]]

======  Figure x. Tethered Configuration  ======

In some instances, such as when additional add-on boards, or capes are connected, the PC may not be able to supply sufficient power for the full system. In that case, review the power requirements for the add-on board/cape; additional power may need to be supplied via the 5v input, but rarely is this the case.

==== 3.3.1 Getting Started  ====

Follow along with the instructions at [https://beagleboard.org/getting-started ''beagleboard.org/getting-started'']

1. Download the latest image onto your computer at [https://bbb.io/latest ''bbb.io/latest'']

Follow the link to the latest image and click on the Debian image for Stretch IoT (non-GUI) for BeagleBone and PocketBeagle via microSD card.  This will download a .img.xz file into the download folder of your computer.

[[https://github.com/jadonk/pocketbeagle-wiki/blob/master/images/PB-gettingstarted-1.png]]

2. Transfer the image to a microSD card

Download and install an SD card programming utility.  We like [https://etcher.io/ ''https://etcher.io/''] 

Insert a new microSD card into a card reader/writer and attach it via the USB connection to your computer.  Follow the instructions on the screen for burning the image from your computer to the microSD card.  Eject the SD card reader when prompted and remove the card.
[[https://github.com/jadonk/pocketbeagle-wiki/blob/master/images/PB-gettingstarted-2.png]]

3. Insert the microSD card into the board - you'll hear a satisfying click when it seats properly into the slot.  It is important that your microSD card is fully inserted prior to powering the system.

<blockquote>Include hardware photo showing insert of microSD Card</blockquote>
======  Figure x. USB Connection to the Board  ======

4. Connect the small connector on the USB cable to the board as shown in '''Figure x'''.

<blockquote>Include hardware photo showing insert of USB to the board</blockquote>

======  Figure x. USB Connection to the Board  ======

5. Connect the large connector of the USB cable to your Linux, Mac or Windows PC USB port.  The board will power on and the power LED will be on as shown in '''Figure x''' below.

[[https://github.com/jadonk/pocketbeagle-wiki/blob/master/images/PB-powerLED-photo.png]]
======  Figure x. Board Power LED  ======

6. As soon as you apply power, the board will begin the booting process and the LEDs will come on in sequence as shown in '''Figure x''' below. It will take a few seconds for the status LEDs to come on, so be patient. The LEDs will be flashing as it begins to boot the Linux kernel.  While the four user LEDS can be over written and used as desired, they do have specific meanings in the image that you've initially placed on your microSD card once the Linux kernel has booted. 

* '''USER0''' is the heartbeat indicator from the Linux kernel.
* '''USER1''' turns on when the microSD card is being accessed
* '''USER2''' is an activity indicator. It turns on when the kernel is not in the idle loop.
* '''USER3''' idle
[[https://github.com/jadonk/pocketbeagle-wiki/blob/master/images/PB-userLED-photo.png]]
======  Figure x. Board Boot Status  ======

==== 3.3.2 Accessing the Board as a Storage Drive  ====

The board will appear as a USB Storage drive on your PC after the kernel has booted, which will take approximately 10 seconds. The kernel on the board needs to boot before the port gets enumerated. Once the board appears as a storage drive, do the following:

# Open the USB Drive folder.
# Click on the file named '''START.HTM'''
# The file running on your PocketBeagle will be opened by your browser on the PC and you should get a display showing the Quick Start Guide.
# Your board is now operational! Follow the instructions on your computer screen to try out the BeagleBone 101 examples:
1.  'Step 1' Power and Boot (you've done this)
2.  'Step 2' Enable a Network Connection (pointing to the DHCP server that is running on your PocketBeagle)
3.  'Step 3' Browse to your Beagle (Brings up a variety of familiar coding examples and tutorials - see figure x.x)
     These examples will run directly on your PocketBeagle from the browser.  You'll find tutorial examples in Bonescript, which uses familiar Arduino function calls (See figure x.x below) as well as using NodeRed and using Cloud 9 IDE.  

[[https://github.com/jadonk/pocketbeagle-wiki/blob/master/images/PB-tutorials.png]]

======  Figure x. Bonescript Examples  ======

==== 3.3.3  Powering Down ====

1. Standard Power Down: Press the power button momentarily with a tap. The system will power down automatically. This will shut down your software with grace.  Software routines will run to completion.  

2. Hard Power Down:  Press the power button for 10 seconds.  This will force an immediate shut down of the software.  For example you may lose any items you have written to the memory.  Holding the button longer than 10 seconds will perform a power reset and the system will power back on.

3. Remove the USB cable.  Remember to hold your board firmly at the USB connection while you remove the cable to prevent damage to the USB connector.

4. If you'd like to power up again without removing the USB cable follow these instructions:
# If you used Step 1 above to power down, to power back up, hold the power button for 10 seconds, release then tap it once and the system will boot normally.
# If you used Step 2 above to power down, to power back up, simply tap the power button and the system will boot normally.

[[https://github.com/jadonk/pocketbeagle-wiki/blob/master/images/PB-powerbutton.png]]
======  Figure x. Power Button  ======

=== 3.4 Other ways to Connect up to your PocketBeagle  ===

==== 3.4.1 Development over a Network Connection  ====

Many host computers support tethering.  In this configuration, the board can be accessed via a shared connection to the internet with any computer. It allows you to create your code remotely and to make the board do whatever you need it to do from a remote location. Details are available at https://www.digikey.com/en/maker/blogs/cdf66181b3a5436e9ad730e4ed4cf9ee

==== 3.4.2 Other examples ====

As other examples become documented, we'll update them on the PocketBeagle Wiki
[https://github.com/beagleboard/pocketbeagle/wiki ''github.com/beagleboard/pocketbeagle/wiki'' ]

See the [https://groups.google.com/forum/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer#!msg/beagleboard/JtOGZb-FH2A/9GVu7I6kAQAJ ''on-line discussion.'']

<blockquote> Method 4)The microUSB connector will act as a USB host. If using a USB-WiFi adapter, you'll need to configure connman to connect to your network initially, then reboot using the USB as a host rather than a client. You'll need to provide power to your board, but microUSB Host/OTG cables sometimes include the power input.
5)Adding the extra USB via the header - look at the pocketbeagle FAQ
It is possible to add an additional USB port as described above.
6)You can utilize a mikroBUS Click Ethernet or wireless module.
7) There are many ways to utilize the expansion interface to create your own networking solution.
</blockquote> 

= '''4.0 PocketBeagle Overview ''' =
PocketBeagle is built around Octavo Systems' OSD335x-SM System-In-Package that integrates a high-performance Texas Instruments AM3358 processor, 512MB of DDR3, power management, nonvolatile serial memory and over 100 passive components into a single package.  This integration saves board space by eliminating several packages that would otherwise need to be placed on the board, but more notably simplifies our board design so we can focus on the user experience.   

The compact PocketBeagle design also offers access through the expansion headers to many of the interfaces and allows for the use of add-on boards called capes and click boards from microElectronica, to add many different combinations of features. A user may also develop their own board or add their own circuitry.

=== 4.1 PocketBeagle Features and Specification  ===

==== 4.1.1 OSD3358-512M-BSM System in Package ====
The Octavo Systems OSD3358-512M-BSM System-In-Package (SiP) is part of a family of products that are building blocks designed to allow easy and cost-effective implementation of systems based in Texas Instruments powerful Sitara AM335x line of processors.  The OSD335x-SM integrates the AM335x along with the TI TPS65217C PMIC, the TI TL5209 LDO, up to 1 GB of DDR3 Memory, a 4 KB EEPROM for non-volatile configuration storage and resistors, capacitors and inductors into a single 21mm x 21mm design-in-ready package.

With this level of integration, the OSD335x-SM family of SiPs allows designers to focus on the key aspects of their system without spending time on the complicated high-speed design of the processor/DDR3 interface or the PMIC power distribution.  It reduces size and complexity of design.  

Full Datasheet and more information is available at [https://octavosystems.com/octavo_products/osd335x-sm/ ''https://octavosystems.com/octavo_products/osd335x-sm/'']

<blockquote> There needs to be a list of the SiP features that are not accessible by the PB board pinout.  What do we want the block diagram to say regarding DDR3 memory size?</blockquote>
=== 5.3 Connectivity  ===

==== 5.3.1 Expansion Headers  ====

PocketBeagle gives access to a large number of peripheral functions and GPIO via 2 dual rail expansion headers.  With 36 pins each, the headers have been left unpopulated to enable users to choose the header connector orientation or add-on board / cape connector style.  Pins are clearly marked on the bottom of the board with additional pin configurations available through software settings.  Detailed information is available in Section 6.x and Section 7.    

[[https://github.com/jadonk/pocketbeagle-wiki/blob/master/images/PB-header-photo.png]]
==== 5.3.2 microSD Connector  ====

The board is equipped with a single microSD connector to act as the primary boot source for the board.  Just about any microSD card you have will work, the install takes less than 2.0G of the memory.
<blockquote> Jason - what is the upper limit size on the microSD card</blockquote>

When plugging in the SD card, the writing on the card should be up. Align the card with the connector and push to insert. Then release. There should be a click and the card will start to eject slightly, but it then should latch into the connector. To eject the card, push the SD card in and then remove your finger. The SD card will be ejected from the connector.

Do not pull the SD card out or you could damage the connector.

[[https://github.com/jadonk/pocketbeagle-wiki/blob/master/images/PB-microSDphoto.jpg]]
====== Figure 21. microSD Connector  ======

==== 5.3.3 USB 2.0 Connector  ====

The board has a microUSB connector that is USB 2.0 HS compatible that connects the USB0 port to the SiP.  Generally this port is used as a client USB port connected to a power source, such as your PC, to power the board. If you would like to use this port in host mode you will need to supply power for peripherals via Header P1 pin 7 (USB1.VIN) or through a powered USB Hub. Additionally, in the USB host configuration, you will need to power the board through Header P1 pin 1 (VIN) or Header P1 pin 7 (USB1.VIN) or Header P2 pin 14 (BAT.VIN)

[[https://github.com/jadonk/pocketbeagle-wiki/blob/master/images/PB-USB-photo.png]]
====== Figure 22. USB 2.0 Connector  ======

Old wording - need new "On the board is a single USB Type A female connector with full LS/FS/HS Host support that connects to USB1 on the processor. The port can provide power on/off control and up to 500mA of current at 5V. Under USB power, the board will not be able to supply the full 500mA, but should be sufficient to supply enough current for a lower power USB device supplying power between 50 to 100mA."

=== 7.5 Serial connection through the pin on the header  ===

details on how to connect and boot through Serial


====== Figure 54. Serial Debug through pins on the header ======

Two signals are provided, TX and RX on this connector. The levels on these signals are 3.3V. In order to access these signals, a FTDI USB to Serial cable is recommended as shown in '''Figure 55''' below.

[[media/image73.jpg|428x162px]]

The cable can be purchased from several different places and must be the 3.3V version TTL-232R-3V3. Information on the cable itself can be found direct from FTDI at:

[http://www.ftdichip.com/Support/Documents/DataSheets/Cables/DS_TTL-232R_CABLES.pdf ''http://www.ftdichip.com/Support/Documents/DataSheets/Cables/DS_TTL232R_CABLES.pdf'' ]

Pin 1 of the cable is the black wire. That must align with the pin 1 on the board which is designated by the white dot next to the connector on the board.

Refer to the support WIKI [http://elinux.org/BeagleBoneBlack ''http://elinux.org/BeagleBoneBlack''] for more sources of this cable and other options that will work.

Table is the pinout of the connector as reflected in the schematic. It is the same as the

FTDI cable which can be found at

[http://www.ftdichip.com/Support/Documents/DataSheets/Cables/DS_TTL-232R_CABLES.pdf ''http://www.ftdichip.com/Support/Documents/DataSheets/Cables/DS_TTL-232R_CABLES.pdf'']

with the exception that only three pins are used on the board. The pin numbers are defined in '''Table 14'''. The signals are from the perspective of the board.

=== 7.9 JTAG PADs and circuitry  ===

A place for an optional 20 pin CTI JTAG header is provided on the board to facilitate the SW development and debugging of the board by using various JTAG emulators. This header is not supplied standard on the board. To use this, a connector will need to be soldered onto the board.

If you need the JTAG connector you can solder it on yourself. No other components are needed. The connector is made by Samtec and the part number is FTR-110-03-G-D-06. You can purchase it from [http://www.digikey.com/ ''www.digikey.com''.]
