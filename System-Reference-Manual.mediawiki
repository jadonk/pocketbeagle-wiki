= '''3.0 Connecting Up Your PocketBeagle ''' =

This section provides instructions on how to hook up your board. Two scenarios will be discussed:

# Tethered to a PC with local development and
# Development over a network connection

=== 3.1 What’s In the Package  ===

In the package you will find two items as shown in '''Figure 1'''.

* PocketBeagle
* Getting Started instruction card with link to the support URL.

<blockquote> insert photo of package and both sides of getting started card </blockquote>

'''Figure 1. In The Package '''

=== 3.2 Connecting the board ===

This section will describe how to connect the board for use. Information can also be found on the Quick Start Guide that came in the box. Detailed information is also available at
[https://beagleboard.org/getting-started ''beagleboard.org/getting-started'' ]

The board can be configured in several different ways, but we will discuss the two most common scenarios.

* Tethered to a PC via the USB cable with local development
** Board is accessed as a storage drive
* Connecting the PocketBeagle to a PC via USB cable and configuring to share access
** Board is accessed via the internet

=== 3.3 Tethered To A PC  ===

In this configuration, you will need the following additional items: 
* miniUSB to USB Type A Cable
* microSD card, 4K minimum

the board is powered by the PC via the USB cable--no other cables are required. The board is accessed either as a USB storage drive or via the browser on the PC. You need to use either Firefox or Chrome on the PC, IE will not work properly. '''Figure 2''' shows this configuration.

[[https://github.com/jadonk/pocketbeagle-wiki/blob/master/images/tethered bbb placeholder.jpg|299x200px]]

======  Figure 2. Tethered Configuration  ======

All the power for the board is provided by the PC via the USB cable. In some instances, such as when additional add-on boards, or capes are connected, the PC may not be able to supply sufficient power for the full system. In that case, review the power requirements for the add-on board/cape; additional power may need to be supplied via the 5v input, but rarely is this the case.

==== 3.3.1 Getting Started  ====

1. Download the latest image at bbb.io/latest 
2. Transfer the image to a microSD card  
<blockquote>do we need an image here like we have on the getting started SW page</blockquote>
<blockquote>do we need to recommend microSD card burning sw here?</blockquote>
3. Insert the microSD card into the board - you'll hear a satisfying click when it seats properly into the slot
<blockquote>shall we have a photo?</blockquote>
4. Connect the small connector on the USB cable to the board as shown in '''Figure 3'''. 

[[media/image9.jpg|451x206px]]

======  Figure 3. USB Connection to the Board  ======

<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li><p>Connect the large connector of the USB cable to your Linux, Mac or Windows PC USB port.</p></li>
<li><p>The board will power on and the power LED will be on as shown in '''Figure 4''' below.</p></li></ol>

[[media/image10.jpg|401x267px]]

======  Figure 4. Board Power LED  ======

4. When the board starts to the booting process started by the process of applying power, the LEDs will come on in sequence as shown in '''Figure 5''' below. It will take a few seconds for the status LEDs to come on, so be patient. The LEDs will be flashing in an erratic manner as it begins to boot the Linux kernel.

[[media/image11.jpg|541x254px]]

======  Figure 5. Board Boot Status  ======

==== 3.3.2 Accessing the Board as a Storage Drive  ====

The board will appear as a USB Storage drive on your PC after the kernel has booted, which will take approximately 10 seconds. The kernel on the board needs to boot before the port gets enumerated. Once the board appears as a storage drive, do the following:

# Open the USB Drive folder.
# Click on the file named '''START.HTM'''
# The file will be opened by your browser on the PC and you should get a display showing the Quick Start Guide.
# Your board is now operational! Follow the instructions on your computer screen.

=== 3.4 Development Over a Network Connection  ===

Many host computers support tethering.  In this configuration, the board can be accessed via a shared connection to the internet with any computer. It allows you to create your code remotely and to make the board do whatever you need it to do from a remote location. This can also make it fun and easy to share projects running on one PocketBeagle.  

[[media/image12.jpg|356x409px]]

======  Figure 6. Network Connected PocketBeagle  ======

==== 3.4.2 Connecting Up the Board  ====

Follow all instructions above in Section 3.3 above.

Next, configure your host to utilize tethering then use the virtual serial port to configure your PocketBeagle to acquire networking information from your host rather than providing it to your host. 

[https://github.com/beagleboard/pocketbeagle/wiki ''github.com/beagleboard/pocketbeagle/wiki'' ]

See the [https://groups.google.com/forum/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer#!msg/beagleboard/JtOGZb-FH2A/9GVu7I6kAQAJ ''on-line discussion.'']
<blockquote>  We will need additional software notes, a picture of the screen, steps for a typical case pc </blockquote>


The microUSB connector will act as a USB host. If using a USB-WiFi adapter, you'll need to configure connman to connect to your network initially, then reboot using the USB as a host rather than a client. You'll need to provide power to your board, but microUSB Host/OTG cables sometimes include the power input.
It is possible to add an additional USB port as described above.
You can utilize a mikroBUS Click Ethernet or wireless module.
There are many ways to utilize the expansion interface to create your own networking solution.

==== 3.4.3 Booting the Board ====

As soon as the power is applied to the board, it will start the booting up process. When the board starts to boot the LEDs will come on in sequence as shown in '''Figure 15''' below. It will take a few seconds for the status LEDs to come on, so be patient. The LEDs will be flashing in an erratic manner as it boots the Linux kernel.

[[media/image11.jpg|541x254px]]

====== Figure 15. Board Boot Status  ======

While the four user LEDS can be over written and used as desired, they do have specific meanings in the image that you've initially placed on your microSD card once the Linux kernel has booted. 

* '''USER0''' is the heartbeat indicator from the Linux kernel.
* '''USER1''' turns on when the microSD card is being accessed
* '''USER2''' idle  <blockquote>  checking with Robert Nelson </blockquote>
* '''USER3''' idle

==== 3.4.4  A Booted System ====

<blockquote> Option for the Networked system - what do the users see on the screen? </blockquote>

8. Powering Down

1. Press the power button momentarily 
2. The system will power down automatically.
3. Remove the power jack.

= '''4.0 PocketBeagle Overview ''' =

The PocketBeagle® ((Value Proposition - still in edit)).   It consists of the OSD3358-512M-BSM, microSD card holder, microUSB connector, and 72 header pins.  The header pins expose many signals that can be used to construct a larger system, like GPIO, PWMs, ADC inputs, USB, and PRU I/O.  

It has been equipped with a minimum set of features to allow the user to experience the power of the processor and is not intended as a full development platform as many of the features and interfaces supplied by the processor are not accessible from the BeagleBone Black via onboard support of some interfaces. It is not a complete product designed to do any particular function. It is a foundation for experimentation and learning how to program the processor and to access the peripherals by the creation of your own software and hardware.

It also offers access to many of the interfaces and allows for the use of add-on boards called capes, to add many different combinations of features. A user may also develop their own board or add their own circuitry.

PocketBeagle is manufactured and warranted by partners listed at https://beagleboard.org/logo for the benefit of the community and its supporters.

The board is designed by x and is based on y

= '''5.0 PocketBeagle High Level Specification ''' =

This section provides the high level specification of the PocketBeagle.

=== 5.1 Block Diagram  ===

'''Figure 19''' below is the high level block diagram of the PocketBeagle.
(may be redundant w/ section 4, combine with section 4 and expand on the spec for the SiP)

[[media/image30.jpg|512x454px]]

'''Figure 19. PocketBeagle Key Components '''

=== 5.2 System in Package (SiP)  ===

Details here for SiP specification - The ODS335x-SM Block Diagram and links to appropriate details on the website

==== 5.3.4 MicroSD Connector  ====

The board is equipped with a single microSD connector to act as the primary boot source for the board.  The connector will support larger capacity microSD cards. The microSD card is not provided with the board. <minimum size> 

==== 5.3.5 Boot Modes  ====

There are three boot modes:  <blockquote> how much of this section is appropriate </blockquote>

* '''SD Boot…''' microSD connector to act as the primary boot source for the board.
* '''Serial Boot…'''This mode will use the serial port to allow downloading of the software direct. A separate USB to serial cable is required to use this port.
* '''USB Boot…'''This mode supports booting over the USB port.

'''''Software to support USB and serial boot modes is not provided by beagleboard.org.'' ''Please contact TI for support of this feature.'' '''  <blockquote> where on the TI website (TI Linux SDK?) should we send them and is it supported for the PocketBeagle </blockquote>

A switch is provided to allow switching between the modes. <blockquote> need engineering review of this section</blockquote>

* Holding the boot switch down during a removal and reapplication of power without a microSD card inserted will force the boot source to be the USB port and if nothing is detected on the USB client port, it will go to the serial port for download.
* Without holding the switch, the board will boot try to boot from the eMMC. If it is empty, then it will try booting from the microSD slot, followed by the serial port, and then the USB port.
* If you hold the boot switch down during the removal and reapplication of power to the board, and you have a microSD card inserted with a bootable image, the board will boot from the microSD card.

'''''NOTE: Pressing the RESET button on the board will NOT result in a change of the'' ''boot mode. You MUST remove power and reapply power to change the boot mode.'' ''The boot pins are sampled during power on reset from the PMIC to the processor.'' ''The reset button on the board is a warm reset only and will not force a boot mode'' ''change.'' '''

=== 5.4 Power Management  ===

<blockquote> Editors note: since the BBBlack had an external PMIC, this section existed.  We could incorporate a mention of power management in the specification section above in section 4 or 5 of the SiP and go into more detail of power mgmt in the power section coming up. </blockquote>


=== 5.5 PC USB Interface  ===

The board has a miniUSB connector that connects the USB0 port to the SiP.

=== 5.6 Serial Debug Port  ===

<blockquote> pins 30/32 on the header - is this something to highlight </blockquote> 

Serial debug is provided via UART0 on the processor via a single 1x6 pin header. In order to use the interface a USB to TTL adapter will be required. The header is compatible with the one provided by FTDI and can be purchased for about $12 to $20 from various sources. Signals supported are TX and RX. None of the handshake signals are supported.

=== 5.7 USB1 Host Port  ===

<blockquote> this is on the header </blockquote>
On the board is a single USB Type A female connector with full LS/FS/HS Host support that connects to USB1 on the processor. The port can provide power on/off control and up to 500mA of current at 5V. Under USB power, the board will not be able to supply the full 500mA, but should be sufficient to supply enough current for a lower power USB device supplying power between 50 to 100mA.

You can use a wireless keyboard/mouse configuration or you can add a HUB for standard keyboard and mouse interfacing.

=== 5.8 Power Sources  ===

The board can be powered from three different sources:

* A USB port on a PC
* A power supply with a USB connector.
* Expansion connectors

<blockquote> need engineering review </blockquote> '''This port is limited to 500mA by the Power Management IC. It is possible to change the settings in the '''TPS65217C''' to increase this current, but only after the initial boot. And, at that point the PC most likely will complain, but you can also use a dual connector USB cable to the PC to get to 1A.'''

Power routed to the board via the expansion header could be provided from power derived on a cape. The DC supply should be well regulated and 5V +/-.25V.

=== 5.10 Power Button  ===

<blockquote> do we reference the button as also a reset button </blockquote>

A power button is provided near the reset button close to the Ethernet connector. This button takes advantage of the input to the PMIC for power down features. While a lot of capes have a button, it was decided to add this feature to the board to ensure everyone had access to some new features. These features include:

* Interrupt is sent to the processor to facilitate an orderly shutdown to save files and to un-mount drives.
* Provides ability to let processor put board into a sleep mode to save power.
* Can alert processor to wake up from sleep mode and restore state before sleep was entered.

If you hold the button down longer than 8 seconds, the board will power off if you release the button when the power LED turns off. If you continue to hold it, the board will power back up completing a power cycle.

'''''''We recommend that you use this method to power down the board. It will also help prevent contamination of the SD card '''''''

If you do not remove the power jack, you can press the button again and the board will power up.

=== 5.11 Indicators  ===

There are a total of five blue LEDs on the board.

* One blue power LED indicates that power is applied and the power management IC is up. If this LED flashes when applying power, it means that an excess current flow was detected and the PMIC has shut down.
* Four blue LEDs that can be controlled via the SW by setting GPIO pins.


=== 5.12 CTI JTAG Header  ===

UPDATE THIS DESCRIPTION TO HIGHLIGHT THE PADS: A place for an optional 20 pin CTI JTAG header is provided on the board to facilitate the SW development and debugging of the board by using various JTAG emulators. This header is not supplied standard on the board. To use this, a connector will need to be soldered onto the board.

If you need the JTAG connector you can solder it on yourself. No other components are needed. The connector is made by Samtec and the part number is FTR-110-03-G-D-06. You can purchase it from [http://www.digikey.com/ ''www.digikey.com''.]

=== 5.14 Cape Board AND CLICK BOARD Support  ===

The PocketBeagle has the ability to accept up to xyz # of  expansion boards or capes that can be stacked onto the expansion headers. The word cape comes from the add-on board shape of the boards that fit onto the original BeagleBone series. (link to story)

For more information on cape support refer to ''Section 9.0''.

= '''6.0 Detailed Hardware Design ''' =
<blockquote> what sections from 6.0 do we need?? <blockquote>

= '''7.0 Connectors ''' =
<blockquote> we will have a chart and pics of the diagrams on the connectors <blockquote>
This section describes each of the connectors on the board.

=== 7.1 Expansion Connectors  ===

The expansion interface on the board is comprised of two 46 pin connectors. All signals on the expansion headers are '''''3.3V''''' unless otherwise indicated.

'''''NOTE: Do not connect 5V logic level signals to these pins or the board will be'' ''damaged.'' '''

'''NOTE: DO NOT APPLY VOLTAGE TO ANY I/O PIN WHEN POWER IS NOT SUPPLIED TO THE BOARD. IT WILL DAMAGE THE PROCESSOR AND VOID THE WARRANTY. '''

'''NO PINS ARE TO BE DRIVEN UNTIL AFTER THE SYS_RESET LINE GOES HIGH. '''

'''Figure 50''' shows the location of the expansion connectors.

[[media/image68.jpg|286x394px]]

====== Figure 50. Expansion Connector Location  ======

=== 7.1.1 P1 Header  ===

=== 7.1.1 P2 Header  ===

=== 7.3 USB Client  ===

The USB Client connector is accessible on the bottom side of the board under the row of four LEDs as shown in '''Figure 52'''. It uses a 5 pin miniUSB cable, the same as is used on the original BeagleBone. The cable is provided with the board. The cable can also be used to power the board.

[[media/image71.jpg|633x454px]]

This port is a USB Client only interface and is intended for connection to a PC.

=== 7.4 USB Host  ===

There is a single USB Host connector on the board and is shown in '''Figure 53''' below.

[[media/image71.jpg|593x387px]]

====== Figure 53. USB Host Connector  ======

The port is USB 2.0 HS compatible and can supply up to 500mA of current. If more current or ports is needed, then a HUB can be used.

=== 7.5 Serial Header  ===

Each board has a debug serial interface that can be accessed by using a special serial cable that is plugged into the serial header as shown in '''Figure 54''' below.

[[media/image71.jpg|527x351px]]

====== Figure 54. Serial Debug Header  ======

Two signals are provided, TX and RX on this connector. The levels on these signals are 3.3V. In order to access these signals, a FTDI USB to Serial cable is recommended as shown in '''Figure 55''' below.

[[media/image73.jpg|428x162px]]

The cable can be purchased from several different places and must be the 3.3V version TTL-232R-3V3. Information on the cable itself can be found direct from FTDI at:

[http://www.ftdichip.com/Support/Documents/DataSheets/Cables/DS_TTL-232R_CABLES.pdf ''http://www.ftdichip.com/Support/Documents/DataSheets/Cables/DS_TTL232R_CABLES.pdf'' ]

Pin 1 of the cable is the black wire. That must align with the pin 1 on the board which is designated by the white dot next to the connector on the board.

Refer to the support WIKI [http://elinux.org/BeagleBoneBlack ''http://elinux.org/BeagleBoneBlack''] for more sources of this cable and other options that will work.

Table is the pinout of the connector as reflected in the schematic. It is the same as the

FTDI cable which can be found at

[http://www.ftdichip.com/Support/Documents/DataSheets/Cables/DS_TTL-232R_CABLES.pdf ''http://www.ftdichip.com/Support/Documents/DataSheets/Cables/DS_TTL-232R_CABLES.pdf'']

with the exception that only three pins are used on the board. The pin numbers are defined in '''Table 14'''. The signals are from the perspective of the board.

=== 7.7 microSD  ===

A microSD connector is located on the back or bottom side of the board as shown in '''Figure 59''' below. The microSD card is not supplied with the board.

[[media/image71.jpg|579x438px]]

====== Figure 59. microSD Connector  ======

When plugging in the SD card, the writing on the card should be up. Align the card with the connector and push to insert. Then release. There should be a click and the card will start to eject slightly, but it then should latch into the connector. To eject the card, push the SD card in and then remove your finger. The SD card will be ejected from the connector.

Do not pull the SD card out or you could damage the connector.

=== 7.9 JTAG Connector  ===

A place for an optional 20 pin CTI JTAG header is provided on the board to facilitate the SW development and debugging of the board by using various JTAG emulators. This header is not supplied standard on the board. To use this, a connector will need to be soldered onto the board.

If you need the JTAG connector you can solder it on yourself. No other components are needed. The connector is made by Samtec and the part number is FTR-110-03-G-D-06. You can purchase it from [http://www.digikey.com/ ''www.digikey.com''.]
